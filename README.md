Bluetooth-Robot
===============

Control the motion of a two-wheeled robot wirelessly from a virtual remote on the computer screen. Using the bluetooth HC-06 reciever and two continuous rotation servos, an Arduino based robot can be programmed to receive values over bluetooth and control the robot accordingly. These control values will be sent to the Arduino from the Serial port on the open source app Processing.
